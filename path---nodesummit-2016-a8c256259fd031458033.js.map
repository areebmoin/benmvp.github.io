I even unexpectedly got to share about how Eventbrite has tackled transitioning our code base over to ES6. But my 15 minutes of fame quickly turned to 15 minutes of shame when:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&quot;<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eventbrite\\\">@eventbrite</a>, we want people to be able to buy tix on desktop...or their crappy Android device.&quot; -<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/benmvp\\\">@benmvp</a> garners crowd laughter <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/NodeSummit\\\">@NodeSummit</a></p>&mdash; jennz0r (@mybluewristband) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mybluewristband/status/758710294075940864\\\">July 28, 2016</a></blockquote>\\n<p>In the moment when I said it I was actually really surprised that there was so much laughter. And I didn‚Äôt understand why Stephen (the Google Developer Advocate!), patted me on the back. But only a few minutes later after we had already moved on to another topic did I realize the confusion. That‚Äôs when the embarrassment rushed in. When I said ‚ÄúWe want people to be able to buy tickets on their crappy Android device‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt trying to say that <strong>all</strong> Android devices are crappy! I actually have a Nexus 5X that I love. I was trying to single out the <em>low-end</em>, crappy Android devices that really struggle to process the large-scale JavaScript apps we‚Äôre building. Oh well, you live and you learn, right?</p>\\n<p>But hey, at least I made up for it with my cool Eventbrite Engineering shirt!</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Love the AJAX <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/YOLO?src=hash\\\">#YOLO</a> shirt on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/benmvp\\\">@benmvp</a> at &quot;Evolution of JavaScript&quot; at <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NodeSummit?src=hash\\\">#NodeSummit</a>. <br><br>You only load once.</p>&mdash; Tierney Coren (@bitandbang) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/bitandbang/status/758713406626988033\\\">July 28, 2016</a></blockquote>\\n<p>The panel lasted about 45 minutes, which seems like an eternity to talk about JavaScript, but it went by surprisingly fast. I feel like our introductions took almost 10 minutes. I think we talked about a lot of great and interesting things, but my only regret is that we didn‚Äôt have more time to answer questions from the audience. I believe we only answered two or three. And due to time constraints, our answers were pretty short. I <em>think</em> what we discussed was interesting to the audience, but when answering audience questions we would <em>know</em> that what we were discussing was pertinent. Not really sure what we could‚Äôve really done differently. Chris did a fantastic job moderating.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, to close here‚Äôs the <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/album/4104052/video/180426378\\\">video</a> of the talk:</p>\\n<div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em\\\"\\n          >\\n            <iframe src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/180426378?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" allowfullscreen style=\\\"\\n            position: absolute;\\n            top: 0;\\n            left: 0;\\n            width: 100%;\\n            height: 100%;\\n          \\\"></iframe>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/180426378\\\">Evolution of Javascript</a> from <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/nodesummit\\\">Node Summit</a> on <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com\\\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\\n          </div>\\n          </div>\\n<p>Many thanks to Chris for inviting me to speak on the panel as well as NodeSummit for hosting such a huge event all about Node and JavaScript!</p>\",\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/nodesummit-2016/\",\"prefix\":\"2016-09-23\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Speaking at NodeSummit 2016\",\"subTitle\":null,\"cover\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"resize\":{\"src\":\"/static/nodesummit-side-f733308590544d7e80f87c464735f1c1-ada8c.jpg\"}}}}},\"author\":{\"id\":\"/home/travis/build/benmvp/benmvp.github.io/content/parts/author.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>Ben is a Christian, husband and father of 2 girls, with a dozen years of experience developing user interfaces for the Web.
