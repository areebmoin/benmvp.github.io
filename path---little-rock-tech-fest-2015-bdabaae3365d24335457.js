My talk was entitled <em>Sugar &#x26; Spice and Everything nice about ES6</em> and it was based on the <a href="/learning-es6-series/"><em>Learning ES6 series</em></a>.</p>\n<p>I think the talk went well. The audience overall wasn’t particularly JavaScript savvy so it was a challenge to explain improvements to JavaScript with ES6 when folks were unfamiliar with ES3/ES5. There were a handful of knowledgeable folks that got something out of it, however. But it ended up being a blessing because I got great practice and it was a positive learning experience. I learned two main things from the talk:</p>\n<p>First, as much as I want to, I cannot explain the whole world. Even though I had 50 minutes (which feels like a long time) there are 30+ features added to ES6 so there was no way I could even adequately explain half of them. I think I ended up trying to explain half of the features and it was just way too much. Way too much for me and way to much for the audience.</p>\n<p>Second, I realized that when I am explaining how a piece of technology works, the <em>why</em> is just as important (if not more important) than the <em>how</em>. I can explain <em>how</em> destructuring works to the cows come home, but if I don’t properly explain <em>why</em> we as JavaScript developers should use it, most people won’t feel any sense of motivation to learn.</p>\n<p>I just gave a shorter 30-minute version of the talk at Nodevember 2015 where I did focus on the <em>why</em> as well as narrowing the scope of the talk. As a result, it went a whole lot better (for me and the attendees). If you’re looking to learn more about ECMAScript 6, I would suggest watching that video instead.
